# Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity


## Overview 
The partially completed dashboard displays demographic information but now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart 
Use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart. 


### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart 
Use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
- The otu_ids as the x-axis values. 
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values.


### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart 
Use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.


### Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
Use HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard.
